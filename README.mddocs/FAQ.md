## Why does the founder receive 5%?

The 5% allocation is not a reward.
It is a responsibility allocation.

It exists to:

- Cover basic operational costs
- Ensure education and documentation continue

This allocation is transparent
and can be questioned or locked by community decision.

## Is the code verified?

Transparency is ensured via:
- Public GitHub repository
- On-chain bytecode comparison
