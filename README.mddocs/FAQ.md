# ZERO Protocol

ZERO is not a promise.  
ZERO is not a roadmap.  
ZERO is not an investment thesis.

ZERO is an education-first crypto experiment.

This project was created from failure, not from hype.

---

## What is ZERO?

ZERO exists to:
- Educate newcomers before they risk capital
- Warn against FOMO, scams, and manipulation
- Encourage learning before participation

ZERO does not exist to:
- Promise profits
- Protect price
- Create artificial hype

If you do not understand, do not participate.  
If you understand, decide for yourself.

---

## Transparency

Everything related to ZERO is public:

- Smart contract source code
- Tokenomics
- Treasury rules
- Community principles

This repository exists so anyone can verify, question, and challenge.

---

## Core Principles

- Knowledge comes before price
- Transparency comes before trust
- Responsibility comes before profit
- If ZERO loses its purpose, ZERO should return to zero

---

## Important Notice

ZERO is not financial advice.  
Participation involves risk.  
Loss is possible.

Education does not eliminate risk,  
but ignorance guarantees it.

---

Everything begins from ZERO.
